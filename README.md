# -Retail-Food-Delivery-Forecast-and-Answering-Business-Questions

Food delivery is a lifeline in our COVID world. In fact, it’s hard to believe that food delivery on such a large scale only became prevalent a few years ago.

If you’re running a meal delivery company, making sure that you have a good gauge of the demand for your service is important—food is perishable and you’d be incurring waste if demand + supply are not managed properly.

In this project, we use UCI Machine Learning Repository’s Demand Forecasting for a store Data Set (dataset no longer publicly available). With 450k+ rows of data over 145 weeks, there are plenty of pertinent business questions we can ask.
